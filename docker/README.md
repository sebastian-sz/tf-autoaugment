### Introduction
This part of the repository allows developing the code inside a docker container.

In order to build the docker container:
```
cd ..
bash docker/build_docker.sh
```

In order to run docker container:
```
bash docker/run_docker.sh
```

Note that both scripts need to be run from the top level directory.
